# Automated Sales Forecasting for Supply Chain Management with FBProphet, Python, and Streamlit

ðŸš€ New Project Alert: Automated Sales Forecasting with FBProphet & Streamlit!

Over the past weeks, I've been diving deep into the intriguing realm of time-series forecasting. By combining the robustness of FBProphet and the interactivity of Streamlit, I've developed a dashboard that:

âœ… Allows users to forecast sales for selected products and plants.  
âœ… Visualizes the comparison between actual sales and forecasted figures.  
âœ… Offers decomposition plots that unravel underlying trends and seasonality.  
âœ… Utilizes Optuna's prowess for hyperparameter optimization.  
âœ… Computes critical performance metrics like RMSE, MAE, and MAPE to evaluate forecasts.  
âœ… Ensures results are stored seamlessly for subsequent analysis and insights.

## Overview

This project is a sales forecasting application using Facebook's Prophet model, enhanced with hyperparameter tuning using Optuna, and built with a user-friendly interface in Streamlit.

## Features

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optuna optimizes Prophet's hyperparameters for improved forecasting accuracy.
- **User Interface**: Streamlit provides an intuitive interface for selecting plant-material combinations and viewing forecasts.
- **Forecasting**: Prophet forecasts future sales based on historical data.
- **Visualization**: The application displays interactive plots and metrics to evaluate the forecasts.
- **Tables**: Provides detailed tables comparing actual sales with forecasted sales.
- **Country-Specific Holidays**: Incorporates country-specific holidays and weekends for more accurate predictions.
- **Cross-Validation**: Provides cross-validation results for understanding the model's capabilities.

## Usage

1. **Train Model**: Click the "Train Model" button to initiate the forecasting process.
2. **View Results**: Use the dropdown menu to select a combination and view the forecast plot, error metrics, and hyperparameters.
3. **Swipe for Dashboard**: Navigate through the dashboard to delve into performance metrics and other visualizations.

## Files and Code Explanation

### sales_forecasting

This directory contains the core functionality of the project.

#### app.py

`app.py` is the main Streamlit application that controls the user interface and functionality.

- **Train Model**:
    - The user clicks the "Train Model" button to initiate the forecasting process.
    - The `compute_forecasts` function generates forecasts for each plant-material combination.
    - The results, including plots, metrics, and tables, are stored in `st.session_state`.
  
- **Dropdown Menu**:
    - The user selects a plant-material combination from the dropdown menu to view specific results.

- **Visualization**:
    - The function `plotly_chart` displays interactive plots using Plotly.
  
- **Metrics**:
    - The application displays RMSE and MAE metrics for the forecasts.

- **Table**:
    - The application displays a table with the forecasted values, actual values, and differences.

#### forecast.py

`forecast.py` contains functions for sales forecasting using Prophet with hyperparameter tuning via Optuna.

- **forecast_prophet_optimized**:
    - This function performs optimized forecasting using Optuna.
    - It returns the forecast plot, RMSE, MAE, best hyperparameters, and a detailed table.

#### objective.py

`objective.py` contains the Optuna objective function for hyperparameter tuning.

- **Objective Function**:
    - The function defines the hyperparameters to be optimized:
        - `seasonality_mode`: Controls how seasonal effects are modeled (additive or multiplicative).
        - `changepoint_prior_scale`: Determines flexibility in detecting changes.
        - `seasonality_prior_scale`: Influences the strength of seasonal components.
        - `fourier_order_monthly`: Sets the number of terms in the Fourier series for monthly seasonality.
        - `yearly_seasonality`: Enables or disables yearly seasonality.
        - `weekly_seasonality`: Enables or disables weekly seasonality.
        - `daily_seasonality`: Enables or disables daily seasonality.
        - `n_changepoints`: Number of potential changepoints.
        - `changepoint_range`: Proportion of the history in which to look for changepoints.

    - The function fits a Prophet model and returns the mean absolute error as the optimization metric.
